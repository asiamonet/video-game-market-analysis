## Project Overview
Working as a lead analyst for the online store "Ice," this project analyzes historical video game sales, user/expert reviews, and platform trends to forecast which games will be the "big winners" in the upcoming fiscal year.

## The Challenge

* **Objective:** Determine if critic scores impact sales and which platforms are currently in their "growth phase."

## Key Technical Skills
* **Regional Analysis:** Creating "user profiles" for North America, Europe, and Japan to identify regional preference trends.
* **Platform Lifecycle Tracking:** Analyzing the rise and fall of gaming platforms to predict future market dominance.
* **Correlation Studies:** Evaluating the relationship between professional reviews (Critic Score) and actual global sales.

## Tools Used
* **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Complex Data Visualization)
* **Statistical Analysis** (Hypothesis Testing)
